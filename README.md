# Project Title
### Who is the Reciter (من القارئ)


## Introduction
We developed a model Capable of determining the name of the reader through a voice clip of Quranic verses.

## Dataset Overview
Collected manually by the team. 
 

## Used Algorithms.
We have used two deep learning algorithms ANN and RNN and the algorithm which gave us the best result were ANN

## Final results and Conclusion
We are pleased to report that our deep learning model successfully predicts the name of a Quran reciter with remarkable accuracy using only a brief sound clip. This project has equipped us with the skills necessary to effectively process and analyze audio files, and to refine our algorithm to make informed predictions.
